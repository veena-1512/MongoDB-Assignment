    "Q1. What is MongoDB? Explain non-relational databases in short. In which scenarios it is preferred to use\n",
    "MongoDB over SQL databases?\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is a popular NoSQL (non-relational) database management system that stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format called BSON (Binary JSON). It is designed to handle large amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data and provides high performance, scalability, and flexibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-relational databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-relational databases, often referred to as NoSQL databases, are a category of database management systems that do not follow the traditional relational database model. Unlike SQL databases, which use a structured schema and tables, NoSQL databases can store and retrieve data in various formats, such as key-value pairs, documents, wide-column stores, or graphs. They are designed to handle different types of data and provide horizontal scalability, making them suitable for scenarios with rapidly changing or evolving data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scenarios where MongoDB is preferred over SQL databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Schema Flexibility:\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB allows for dynamic and flexible schemas. This is particularly advantageous when dealing with data that doesn't fit neatly into a fixed, predefined structure, making it easier to adapt to changing requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Unstructured Data:\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is well-suited for handling unstructured or semi-structured data, such as JSON documents. This makes it a good choice for applications where the data structure is not known in advance or where it may vary across different records.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Horizontal Scalability:\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is designed to scale horizontally by adding more servers to a distributed database. This makes it suitable for applications with large and growing datasets that require scalability.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Agile Development:\n",
    "\n",
    "In agile development environments where requirements evolve rapidly, MongoDB's flexibility can be beneficial. Changes to the data model can be made without the need for extensive schema modifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Document-Oriented Data Model:\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB stores data in a document-oriented format, using BSON documents. This document-based approach allows for the representation of complex data structures and relationships in a way that is natural for many programming languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Real-time Applications:\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is often used in scenarios where real-time data processing and analysis are crucial, such as in applications that require constant updates and quick access to data.\n"

    "Q2. State and Explain the features of MongoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is a widely used NoSQL database management system that offers several features to meet the requirements of modern, scalable, and flexible applications. Here are some key features of MongoDB:\n",

    "\n",
    "MongoDB is a widely used NoSQL database management system that offers several features to meet the requirements of modern, scalable, and flexible applications. Here are some key features of MongoDB:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Document-Oriented:\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB stores data in flexible, JSON-like BSON (Binary JSON) documents. Each document can have a different structure, and complex data structures can be nested within documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Schema Flexibility:\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB has a dynamic schema, allowing documents in the same collection to have different fields. This flexibility is particularly useful in scenarios where the data structure evolves over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Indexing:\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB supports various types of indexes, including compound indexes, geospatial indexes, and text indexes. Indexing improves query performance by allowing the database to quickly locate and retrieve the required data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Aggregation Framework:\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB provides a powerful aggregation framework for data processing and transformation. It supports operations such as filtering, grouping, sorting, and projecting data, enabling complex transformations within the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. High Performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is designed for high performance and can handle large volumes of data and traffic. It supports automatic sharding to distribute data across multiple servers, enabling horizontal scalability.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Horizontal Scalability:\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB can scale horizontally by distributing data across multiple servers or clusters. This makes it suitable for applications with growing data requirements, allowing them to scale out as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Document Validation:\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB allows you to define document validation rules to enforce data integrity. This feature helps ensure that documents satisfy specific criteria, preventing the insertion of invalid or inconsistent data.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Built-in Replication:\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB supports replica sets, which are sets of MongoDB instances that maintain the same data. Replica sets provide data redundancy, fault tolerance, and automatic failover in the event of a primary node failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. GridFS:\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB includes a specification called GridFS for storing and retrieving large files, such as images, videos, and audio files. GridFS divides large files into smaller chunks, making it easier to manage and retrieve them.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Security:\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB provides various security features, including authentication, authorization, role-based access control, and encryption. It supports TLS/SSL for secure communication between clients and servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. Ad Hoc Queries:\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB supports ad hoc queries, allowing developers to query the database in a flexible manner. This is particularly useful during development and testing phases.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. Community and Ecosystem:\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB has a vibrant and active community, and it is supported by a rich ecosystem of drivers, libraries, and tools for various programming languages and platforms\n"
